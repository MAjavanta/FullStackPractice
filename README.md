This is a series of small sites and projects carried out to practice and learn full stack web development.

This is helping me sure up my foundations in HTML and CSS, as well as gain experience with JavaScript, and eventually React, TypeScript, and Next.js

1. SpaceExploration - simple HTML and CSS learning how to properly use background images
2. HometownSite - solo project that allowed me to explore using better semantic HTML as well as using Flexbox in CSS
3. Blackjack - first complete webapp using JavaScript for the logic, revising basic syntax of the language, including arrays, logical operators, for loops, and JavaScript objects
